main.go: The main entry point of your application. It initializes the necessary components and starts the Telegram bot.
go.mod: The Go module file that defines the project's dependencies.
cmd/bot/main.go: The main package for your Telegram bot. It sets up the bot, registers handlers, and starts listening
for incoming messages.
internal/bot/bot.go: Contains the main logic of your Telegram bot, including message handling and responding to user
queries.
internal/bot/handlers/: Directory for different message handlers.
tokens.go: Handles user requests for retrieving token information.
protocols.go: Handles user requests for retrieving blockchain protocol information.
internal/blockchain/blockchain.go: Contains the code for interacting with the blockchain, including retrieving token
balances and protocol interactions.
internal/storage/storage.go: Handles data storage and retrieval, storing user information, token balances, and protocol
interactions.
pkg/telegram/client.go: Contains a wrapper for interacting with the Telegram Bot API, abstracting the underlying details
of sending and receiving messages.
config/config.go: Contains configuration settings for your bot, such as API keys, blockchain endpoints, and database
credentials.
This structure separates your code into logical components, making it easier to manage and maintain. The cmd directory
contains the application's main package, while the internal directory holds internal packages that are specific to your
application. The pkg directory is for reusable packages that can be used in other projects. Finally, the config
directory holds configuration files or modules.

Remember, this is just one example structure, and you can modify it based on your specific needs and preferences.

Bot Setup and Authentication:

Create a Telegram bot using the Telegram Bot API.
Obtain an API key/token for your bot from the BotFather.
Set up the necessary authentication and security measures for interacting with the blockchain.
Blockchain Integration:

Choose a blockchain platform that supports the protocols and tokens you want to track. Ethereum is a popular choice, but
you can select others based on your requirements.
Set up a connection to the blockchain network using appropriate APIs or SDKs. For example, you can use web3.js for
Ethereum.
Configure your app to listen for blockchain events or periodically query the blockchain for relevant data.
User Interaction:

Define the commands and interactions your Telegram bot will support, such as /tokens or /protocols.
Set up event handlers for incoming user messages and commands.
Implement the necessary logic to process user requests and retrieve relevant data from the blockchain.
Data Storage and Retrieval:

Design a data storage system to persist user information and their blockchain interactions. You can use a database like
MongoDB or a key-value store like Redis.
Map user identities (Telegram user IDs) to their blockchain addresses or wallets for tracking purposes.
Store relevant data such as token balances and the protocols users have interacted with.
Bot Responses:

Generate appropriate responses based on user queries and retrieved data.
Format the responses as Telegram messages and send them back to the users.
Consider providing additional information such as token prices, transaction history, or protocol details if desired.
Error Handling and Notifications:

Implement error handling mechanisms to handle cases where the blockchain is unreachable, API calls fail, or unexpected
issues occur.
Notify users of any errors or failures gracefully to provide a good user experience.
Deployment and Scaling:

Deploy your Telegram bot on a server or cloud platform.
Consider implementing scaling mechanisms if the number of users or requests increases over time.
